        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political Scienceüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Jason Choe, I'm 19 years old and a first year at the University of California Riverside. I am part of a family of six which includes my dad, mom, older brother, younger brother, and younger sister. My goal is to get straight A's throughout college, go to law school, and become a corporate lawyer. My hobbies include playing basketball, working out, hanging with friends, eating, sleeping, and talking to my best friends. My priorities, organization, and work ethic are superb because I always am my best version of myself. I have always been one of the top in my class, the biggest hustler throughout practice and games, and the employee of the week. My work experience includes working at Home Depot as a cashier where we gave excellent customer service, had quick in and out check out, and managed the front floor. I also worked in construction as a tech where I received a license to cure cylinders and test their environmental factors, to make sure they were ready to be used for buildings, sidewalks, etc. I still work this job to this day. I also have several leadership qualities. There are always two sides to every story. In my story, Jason Choe is the one who desires to make a difference and not only portray the asian stereotypes. He shines and changes the culture. Starting in Kindergarten, I‚Äôve always approached students and connected with them, which made them more comfortable. It lead them to approach me with their own personal issues, wanting unbiased opinions to settle disputes, or just talk. These daily encounters led me to becoming a Link Crew Leader in highschool. I would assist and encourage my fellow peers who were struggling academically, emotionally or in life in general. Freshman students are very shy and awkward when entering highschool, so I would start by doing the activities first and then encourage them to join in which worked. Encouragement is included in sports. I‚Äôve been the team captain of Santiago Varsity Basketball since 10th grade, and this leadership position is an honor, nominated through hard work and passion for the game. My teammates look up to me to lead in workouts, practices, and games. Adding, winning Homecoming King was the highlight of my senior year. The ‚Äúunderdog‚Äù was my title because my other four contestants had the favor. To win, I developed new bonds with all my classmates. I have encouraged those who are the underdogs to come out of their comfort zones as I did. In my community, people were shocked to see an asian male win, others were proud. In my story, I am a young man who made a difference. I am the one who changed this societal stereotype, and I continue to pursue excellence, hoping to set the standard for others to reach. <br><br>
